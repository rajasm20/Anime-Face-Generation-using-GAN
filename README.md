This is a DCGAN project. We have generated high quality anime faces by training generator.
There are two neural networks: a Generator and a Discriminator. The generator generates a "fake" sample given a random vector/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is "real" (picked from the training data) or "fake" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: we train the discriminator for a few epochs, then train the generator for a few epochs, and repeat. This way both the generator and the discriminator get better at doing their jobs.

GANs however, can be notoriously difficult to train, and are extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, activation functions and regularization. In this tutorial, we'll train a GAN to generate images of anime characters' faces.

## Discriminator Network

The discriminator takes an image as input, and tries to classify it as "real" or "generated". In this sense, it's like any other neural network. We'll use a convolutional neural networks (CNN) which outputs a single number output for every image. We'll use stride of 2 to progressively reduce the size of the output feature map.

## Note that we're using the Leaky ReLU activation for the discriminator.

>  Different from the regular ReLU function, Leaky ReLU allows the pass of a small gradient signal for negative values. As a result, it makes the gradients from the discriminator flows stronger into the generator. Instead of passing a gradient (slope) of 0 in the back-prop pass, it passes a small negative gradient.  - [Source](https://sthalles.github.io/advanced_gans/)

Just like any other binary classification model, the output of the discriminator is a single number between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability of the input image being real i.e. picked from the original dataset.

## Generator Network

The input to the generator is typically a vector or a matrix of random numbers (referred to as a latent tensor) which is used as a seed for generating an image. The generator will convert a latent tensor of shape `(128, 1, 1)` into an image tensor of shape `3 x 28 x 28`. To achive this, we'll use the `ConvTranspose2d` layer from PyTorch, which is performs to as a *transposed convolution* (also referred to as a *deconvolution*).

We use the TanH activation function for the output layer of the generator.

> "The ReLU activation (Nair & Hinton, 2010) is used in the generator with the exception of the output layer which uses the Tanh function. We observed that using a bounded activation allowed the model to learn more quickly to saturate and cover the color space of the training distribution. Within the discriminator we found the leaky rectified activation (Maas et al., 2013) (Xu et al., 2015) to work well, especially for higher resolution modeling." - [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41489907/generative-adversarial-networks-tanh)


Note that since the outputs of the TanH activation lie in the range `[-1,1]`, we have applied the similar transformation to the images in the training dataset. Let's generate some outputs using the generator and view them as images by transforming and denormalizing the output.

## Discriminator Training

Since the discriminator is a binary classification model, we can use the binary cross entropy loss function to quantify how well it is able to differentiate between real and generated images.

## Full Training Loop

We define a `fit` function to train the discriminator and generator in tandem for each batch of training data. We'll use the Adam optimizer with some custom parameters (betas) that are known to work well for GANs. We will also save some sample generated images at regular intervals for inspection.
